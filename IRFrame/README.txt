INFORMATION RETRIEVAL OVERVIEW:

Information retrieval (IR) is finding material (usually documents) of an unstructured nature (usually text) that satisfies an information need 
from within large collections(usually stored on computers).

The goal of IR is to retrieve information that is relevant  to the user’s information need and helps the user complete a task.

PROJECT SCOPE:

Our project aims to retrieve information for phrase querries. It takes an input from the user and returns the document where the phrase
is found. The number of terms in a query depends on the user, quantity of terms is handled by the program. The program was also designed to handle
special characters and is case insensitive. Two terms are searched with a proximity of two.
